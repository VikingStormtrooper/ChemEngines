README - Chemical Engines v. 0.1.0 for KSP 1.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This mod requires RealFuels by NathanKell to work -> http://bit.ly/1cgOqD9

INSTALLATION:
Remove any existing version of the mod; then copy the ChemEngines and RealFuels-ChemEngines folders to Kerbal Space Program/GameData.

INSTRUCTIONS:
The ChemEngines folder contains the models, textures, and configs of the additional engines provided with the mod, together with plume effects. MiniAVC (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745) is used in order to give KSP information about the currently installed version of the mod.
The RealFuels-ChemEngines folder contains the engine definitions for RealFuels.

TO DO:
Create new parts, add emissive shaders to nozzles, create ad hoc FX. Future engines will need real UV maps.

CHANGELOG:
v. 0.1.0 01/03/17 - First working engine, still lots of things to do
